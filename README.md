Credit Scoring Model
This repository contains a credit scoring model that predicts the creditworthiness of individuals using historical financial data. The model utilizes machine learning classification algorithms to assess the risk associated with potential borrowers.

Features
Data Handling: The model processes missing data by filling categorical columns with their respective modes.
Label Encoding: All categorical variables are label-encoded to prepare them for model training.
Model: A Random Forest Classifier is used to build the model, with class_weight='balanced' to address class imbalances in the dataset.
Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
Algorithm Used
Random Forest Classifier: A robust and widely used classification algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language for data manipulation, model development, and evaluation.
Pandas: For data loading and preprocessing.
scikit-learn: Used for splitting data, training the Random Forest classifier, and evaluating model performance.
Matplotlib: For future data visualization needs.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure all required libraries are installed:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Load the dataset and run the code to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Modify the code for different classification algorithms or hyperparameters as needed.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is german_credit_data.csv, which contains financial information and labels of creditworthiness ("Risk") for each individual.

Results
The model achieves an accuracy score of around X% (based on the evaluation). Further improvements can be made by tuning hyperparameters or using other advanced models.
