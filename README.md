Credit Scoring Model
A credit scoring model developed to predict the creditworthiness of individuals using historical financial data. The model applies machine learning classification algorithms to assess the risk of potential borrowers.

Features
Data Handling: Automatically fills missing data in categorical columns with the mode.
Label Encoding: Encodes categorical variables for model compatibility.
Model: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to build the model, with class_weight='balanced' to manage class imbalances.
Evaluation: The model's performance is measured using:
Accuracy
Classification Report
Confusion Matrix
Tech Stack
Python: The programming language for this project.
Pandas: For data loading and preprocessing.
scikit-learn: Used for splitting data, training the Random Forest classifier, and model evaluation.
Matplotlib: For data visualization (future enhancements).
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-scoring-model.git
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Load the dataset (german_credit_data.csv) and run the code to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Modify the code to experiment with different classification algorithms or hyperparameters.
Dataset
The model is trained on the german_credit_data.csv dataset, which contains financial information and a "Risk" label indicating the creditworthiness of individuals.
